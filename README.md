# BubbleSort

## Description
This Java project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, one of the simplest sorting techniques. The program sorts an array of integers by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The sorting process continues until the array is completely sorted.

## Requirements
- Java 21.0.2 or later

## Usage
To run the program, compile the `BubbleSort.java` file and execute it. The program will print the sorted array to the console after performing the sorting operation.

### Example Output
2 3 5 8 9

### How the Bubble Sort Works:
1. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
2. If the first element is greater than the second, swap them.
3. Continue through the array until no more swaps are needed.
4. The array is now sorted.

### Code Structure:
- The `while` loop continues until no more swaps are needed.
- The `for` loop iterates through the array and compares adjacent elements.
- The `swap` variable is used to keep track of whether any swaps have been made during the iteration.
